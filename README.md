# Convert_roman



####It's a bash script that can convert the number into the Roman digit.

##Script breakdown:
This script is based on three functions.

###First function :
It will evaluate how many digits are there in user inputs Then after evaluating it will goto switch case and as per evaluation it will check case # base number of digit. once identified it will call the second function.

###Second function :
It will convert the number into a roman digit based on three var. which will be LOW, MED, High and in the end the digit.

  ####First condition :
    If a digit is less the  4; then print the first letter from first function i.e LOW and digit(number of time ) is will goto next function.

###Third function :
this will take input from the second function and then will print that letter and the iteration that how many times it has to print will take in place and print it.
